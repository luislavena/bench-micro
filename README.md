# bench some web microframeworks (Ruby)

Because we don't have enough drama, let's bench some *hello world* apps!

## Why?

As part of some research, collected some benchmark around Ruby web
microframeworks.

The idea is bench the performance from [Rack](https://github.com/rack/rack),
throught the stack of the framework to the minimum representation of an
application (*Hello World* apps).

It is not the goal to bechmark hits to the database or external services,
nor to do a silly *fibonacci-as-a-service*, ok?

## What?

Rack 2 compatible frameworks

- [Cuba](https://github.com/soveran/cuba) - [cuba.ru](apps/cuba.ru)
- [Flame](https://github.com/AlexWayfer/flame) - [flame.ru](apps/flame.ru)
- [Grape](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape) - [grape.ru](apps/grape.ru)
- [Hanami (Router)](https://github.com/hanami/router) - [hanami-router.ru](apps/hanami-router.ru)
- [Hobbit](https://github.com/patriciomacadden/hobbit) - [hobbit.ru](apps/hobbit.ru)
- [Hobby](https://github.com/ch1c0t/hobby) - [hobby.ru](apps/hobby.ru)
- [Newark](https://github.com/mje113/newark) - [newark.ru](apps/newark.ru)
- [Plezi](https://github.com/boazsegev/plezi) - [plezi.ru](apps/plezi.ru)
- [Rack](https://github.com/rack/rack) - [rack.ru](apps/rack.ru) + [rack-response.ru](apps/rack-response.ru)
- [Rack-App](https://github.com/rack-app/rack-app) - [rack-app.ru](apps/rack-app.ru)
- [Rack-Routing](https://github.com/georgeu2000/rack-routing) - [rack-routing.ru](apps/rack-routing.ru)
- [RackStep](https://github.com/mfdavid/rackstep) - [rackstep.ru](apps/rackstep.ru)
- [Rails (API + Metal)](https://github.com/rails/rails) - [rails-api.ru](apps/rails-api.ru)  + [rails-metal.ru](apps/rails-metal.ru)
- [Rambutan](https://github.com/NewRosies/rambutan) - [rambutan.ru](apps/rambutan.ru)
- [Roda](https://github.com/jeremyevans/roda) - [roda.ru](apps/roda.ru)
- [Sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra) - [sinatra.ru](apps/sinatra.ru)
- [Syro](https://github.com/soveran/syro) - [syro](apps/syro.ru)
- [Watts](https://github.com/pete/watts) - [watts](apps/watts.ru)

Please note that while Rails has been added to the list, it is just a
minimalistic representation with ActionPack gem (using API and Metal, no full middleware stack, etc). You
shouldn't take the performance numbers mentioned here about Rails (or any
other) as scientific and decision-taking references.

## How?

Used [wrk](https://github.com/wg/wrk) to benchmark, locally, a burst of
requests (in 2 threads) over 10 seconds. The command line used was:

```console
$ wrk -t 2 http://localhost:9292/
```

All the frameworks using [Puma](https://github.com/puma/puma) on
Ruby 2.4, in production mode with 16 threads:

```console
$ puma -e production -t 16:16 apps/<framework.ru>
```

## Run benchmark for all frameworks

```console
# use `bundle exec`, if needed
$ bench/summary-memory
$ bench/summary-speed
```

### Have some numbers around?

Yup, I do:
